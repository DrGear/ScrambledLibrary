# ScrambledLibrary
A library implementation of a non-published repo of mine called Scrambled, a script which takes a sentence and turns it into a completely new one using 3 methods.
---
All you need is a word and to set 2 parameters.

# Example:
```python
from ScrambledLibrary import deviled, sunnysideup, doubleyolk #you can do multiple methods or just 1

text = input("some text goes here")

#1st param is the text, 2nd param is weither to output it to a file or just the console.

#you can use just one method here or use multiple.
deviled.scramble(text, True)
```
